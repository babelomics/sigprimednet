# SigPrimedNet: a signaling-informed neural network for scRNA-seq annotation of known and unknown cell types


- Experiments and exporting the prior biological knowledge information steps are shared in 'project_bash.sh' file.

- Figures, shared in paper and supplementary files, can be created by using notebooks in 'SigPrimedNet_figures' folder.
